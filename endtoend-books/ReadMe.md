GPT Prompts:
1) I want to create a front end react app using vite framework and a backend using rest apis to create a database of books. The book database should contain length, breadth and thickness of books. May be title, edition, genre and author, publishing date can be included. Could you get me a front end app for the same.
2) Could you give me the backend express code to have these api's implemented in a server.js
3) Could you help me have persistence in the database(mongodb) by modifying the server

I had previously installed Mongdb. and Mongdb Compass.
